# Todo Undo Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a time-based undo feature for todo operations (complete/incomplete and delete). Users now have 8 seconds to undo their actions after marking a task as complete/incomplete or deleting it.

## How It Works

### 1. **Task Completion**
- When you check a task as complete, it immediately updates
- A toast notification appears with an "Undo" button (only for marking complete)
- The toast has a countdown timer showing remaining time
- Clicking "Undo" reverts the task back to incomplete
- When unchecking a task, you get a simple success message (no undo)

### 2. **Task Deletion**
- When you delete a task, it's immediately removed
- An undo toast appears allowing you to restore the task
- If you undo, the task is recreated with all its original data

### 3. **User Experience Features**
- **Visual Countdown**: Progress bar shows time remaining
- **Hover to Pause**: Hovering over the toast pauses the countdown
- **Multiple Toasts**: Stack multiple undo actions
- **Smooth Animations**: Professional transitions and effects

## Technical Implementation

### Components Added:
1. **`ToastWithUndo.tsx`** - Enhanced toast component with undo support
2. **`ToastContainer.tsx`** - Container for managing multiple toasts
3. **`useToastWithUndo.ts`** - Hook for managing toast state
4. **`useTodos.undo.ts`** - Enhanced todos hook with undo functionality

### Key Features:
- **Optimistic Updates**: Changes appear instantly
- **Rollback on Undo**: Reverts both UI and server state
- **Error Handling**: Falls back to fetching fresh data if undo fails
- **Cleanup**: Proper timeout cleanup on unmount

## Usage

The feature is automatically enabled for all todo operations:

```typescript
// In TasksTab component
const { toasts, showToast, removeToast } = useToastWithUndo();

// When toggling a todo
await toggleTodo(todoId); // Shows undo toast automatically

// When deleting a todo
await deleteTodo(todoId); // Shows undo toast automatically
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Misclicks**: Users can quickly recover from accidental actions
2. **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't block workflow with confirmations
3. **Clear Feedback**: Visual confirmation with countdown
4. **Professional UX**: Matches modern app patterns (Gmail, etc.)

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Check/uncheck any task - see the undo toast
2. Click "Undo" within 8 seconds to revert
3. Delete a task and use undo to restore it
4. Try multiple rapid actions to see toast stacking

The undo duration is configurable via the `UNDO_DURATION` constant (currently 8 seconds).
