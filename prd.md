# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Course Page Functionality

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the course page functionality within our platform. The goal is to provide users with a comprehensive and customizable workspace for each of their courses, incorporating AI-powered features to improve productivity and organization.

## 2. Current State

The existing platform features a Next.js frontend utilizing Clerk for authentication, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, and Shadcn UI components. The backend is built with Node.js/Express and MongoDB. User-specific data is managed, but the current course pages lack advanced customization and the specific functionalities outlined in this PRD.

## 3. Problem/Opportunity

Users currently lack a centralized and intelligent platform to manage their course-specific information, tasks, and resources. This leads to inefficiencies in tracking assignments, deadlines, and course materials. There is an opportunity to significantly improve user engagement and academic performance by providing a highly functional and customizable course page experience.

## 4. Target Users & Use Cases

- **Target Users:** Students enrolled in courses on the platform.
- **Use Cases:**
  - As a student, I want to upload and organize all my course-specific files in one place.
  - As a student, I want to upload my course syllabus and have the system automatically extract and display important information like grading policies, due dates, and contact information.
  - As a student, I want a clear and organized view of upcoming deadlines and tasks.
  - As a student, I want to manage my course-related tasks efficiently (add, check off, remove, edit).
  - As a student, I want to leverage AI agents to assist with completing assignments based on provided materials and prompts.
  - As a student, I want a visually appealing and intuitive interface for all these features.

## 5. Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch

We will develop highly customizable course pages that empower students to manage their academic workload effectively. These pages will allow file uploads, AI-powered syllabus indexing for automatic information extraction (grading, deadlines, contacts), a comprehensive task management system, and the ability to create AI agents for assignment assistance. All data will be securely stored per user, presented through a beautiful and intuitive UI/UX.

## 6. Goals/Measurable Outcomes

- **Goal 1:** Increase user engagement with course pages by X% (to be defined).
- **Goal 2:** Improve task completion rates for users utilizing the new features by Y% (to be defined).
- **Goal 3:** Achieve a high user satisfaction score (e.g., >4.0/5.0) for the new course page functionalities in user surveys.

## 7. MVP/Functional Requirements

### 7.1. File Management (P0)

- **[P0]** Users must be able to upload files (e.g., lecture notes, readings, assignments) specific to each course.
- **[P0]** Uploaded files should be stored securely and associated with the specific user and course.
- **[P1]** Users should be able to view, download, and delete uploaded files.
- **[P1]** Display file type icons and last modified dates.

### 7.2. Syllabus Processing & Information Extraction (P0)

- **[P0]** Users must be able to upload a course syllabus (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
- **[P0]** The system must integrate with an AI service to parse and index the syllabus content.
- **[P0]** Upon successful indexing, the system must automatically identify and extract:
  - Grading breakdown and weights.
  - Assignment due dates.
  - Exam dates.
  - TA contact information (name, email if available).
  - Professor contact information (name, email, phone number if available).
- **[P0]** Extracted dates (assignments, exams) must be displayed on a calendar view within the course page.
- **[P0]** Extracted assignment due dates must populate a "Task List" (see 7.3).
- **[P0]** Extracted contact information (TA, Professor) must be displayed in a dedicated "Contacts" section on the course page.
- **[P1]** Provide a mechanism for users to review and correct extracted information.
- **[P2]** Notify users if the AI has low confidence in certain extracted details.

### 7.3. Task Management (P0)

- **[P0]** Users must be able to manually add new tasks to a task list specific to each course.
- **[P0]** Each task entry must allow for a title, description (optional), and due date.
- **[P0]** Tasks generated from syllabus indexing (see 7.2) must automatically appear in this list.
- **[P0]** Users must be able to mark tasks as complete (check off).
- **[P0]** Users must be able to edit existing tasks (title, description, due date).
- **[P0]** Users must be able to remove tasks from the list.
- **[P0]** The task list must be organized and visually appealing, clearly indicating overdue, upcoming, and completed tasks.
- **[P1]** Allow users to prioritize tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **[P1]** Implement sorting and filtering options (e.g., by due date, by priority, by status).

### 7.4. AI Agent for Assignment Assistance (P1)

- **[P1]** Users must be able to create "AI Agents" for specific courses.
- **[P1]** When creating an agent, users should be able to:
  - Provide a name or purpose for the agent.
  - Assign relevant uploaded files (from 7.1) as context for the agent.
  - Input specific prompts or instructions for the agent.
  - Upload screenshots as context for the agent.
- **[P1]** The agent should operate in the background to process the provided information and generate output based on the user's prompt (e.g., draft an essay, summarize notes, answer questions).
- **[P1]** The output generated by the agent must be displayed to the user within the course page.
- **[P2]** Allow users to iterate on agent outputs by providing further prompts or feedback.
- **[P2]** Provide transparency about the AI's limitations and potential for errors.

### 7.5. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) (P0)

- **[P0]** All new functionalities must be presented through a beautiful, intuitive, and responsive user interface, consistent with the existing platform's design language (Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI).
- **[P0]** Course pages must be fully customizable by the user in terms of layout and visibility of different sections (files, syllabus info, task list, agents).
- **[P0]** Navigation within the course page and to/from other parts of the platform must be seamless.
- **[P0]** All interactive elements must provide clear visual feedback and follow accessibility best practices (e.g., `cursor-pointer` for clickable items).

### 7.6. Data Persistence (P0)

- **[P0]** All user-specific information (uploaded files, syllabus data, tasks, agent configurations, customizations) must be saved reliably in the user's specific database allocation (MongoDB).
- **[P0]** Data must be loaded efficiently when the user accesses their course page.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Course pages should load quickly, even with a large number of files or tasks. AI processing should not block UI interactions.
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and courses.
- **Security:** All user data must be stored securely, with appropriate access controls. File uploads should be scanned for malicious content.
- **Reliability:** The system should be reliable, with minimal downtime. Data integrity is crucial.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and update.

## 9. Future Considerations (Out of MVP Scope)

- Real-time collaboration features on tasks or notes.
- Deeper integration with external calendar services.
- Automated reminders for upcoming deadlines.
- Gamification elements to encourage task completion.
- Advanced analytics on study habits and performance.
