## Quick Scenario

It’s Thursday night before a Calc mid‑term. You search “implicit differentiation” in Homebase. The AI surfaces a tagged snippet from last month’s lecture PDF, a peer’s annotated worksheet, and a short Loom explainer you saved. You skim, add a todo “practice 5 problems,” and invite your study group to co‑edit a guide—all within the same tab.
